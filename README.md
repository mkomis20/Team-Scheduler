```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Navigate to the application directory and run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### First-Time Setup

1. **Initial Login**: Log in with an existing employee account or have an admin add you

- Can view detailed reports and analytics

**User Role:**

- Read-only access to Dashboard

## Data Storage

The application uses local file storage with the following structure:

```
wfh_data/
â”œâ”€â”€ employees.json           # Employee information (names, IDs, passwords, roles, leave balances)
â”œâ”€â”€ wfh_records.csv          # Work From Home schedule records
â”œâ”€â”€ annual_leave_records.csv # Annual Leave schedule records
â””â”€â”€ seminar_records.csv      # Seminar attendance records (with seminar names)
```

These files are automatically created on first run.

## Customization

### Changing the Default Admin

emp['role'] = 'Admin' if emp['name'] == 'Your Name' else 'User'
```

### Adjusting Default Leave Balance

Modify the default annual leave balance (default: 20 days) in the employee management section.

### Low Occupancy Threshold

Change the 30% threshold in [app.py:558](app.py#L558) and [app.py:589](app.py#L589):

```python
low_occupancy = occupancy[occupancy['in_office'] < len(employees) * 0.3]  # Change 0.3 to desired threshold
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start:**

- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pip install streamlit pandas plotly`
- Check Python version: `python --version` (should be 3.7+)

**Can't log in:**

- Default password for all new users is `1234`
- Check that employees.json exists in wfh_data folder
- Contact admin to reset your password

**Data not saving:**

3. **Leave Planning**: Schedule annual leave well in advance
4. **Office Coordination**: Monitor occupancy alerts to maintain minimum office presence
5. **Data Export**: Regularly export CSV reports for record-keeping
